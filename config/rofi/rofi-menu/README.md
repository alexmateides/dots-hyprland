# rofi-menu

My attempt to create framework for designing static menus in [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)

Inspired by [miphreal's python rofi menu](https://github.com/miphreal/python-rofi-menu)

#### TODO 

- [ ] Animated waiting button for bluetooth connect/scanning
- [ ] Fix submenu return position
- [ ] Add Hash based session storage path
